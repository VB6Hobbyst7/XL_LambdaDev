May need to move some of the XML list related functionality in the Lambda Manager into the ListStorage in standard VBA code library

Replace Outdated repos with standard code libraries

Maybe request target path for lambda exports
 - and remember previous choice
 - notify of file overwrite

Instead of adding the Lambda repos to active workbook add them to the addin workbook so they can be imported into any workbook - how can they be identified and be refreshed?

I am tempted to bring in the list storage class into the project
 - store the repos in a listStorage class object

Create category functionality within the lambdas (most probably have to store in the comments)

 - Lambdas can be refreshed in target sheet with spreadsheetBI, maybe with a listbox of lambda selections so that all lambdas do not clutter up spreadsheet
    
 - Maybe create an add-in with a combined roll of generator of table as well as refresher of defined names

 - Need to complete Function IsValidRepo

 Create a XL LambdaDev tab on ribbon

  How hard would it be to create Excel formula language support in Visual Studio code
 * Additioal complexity would be difficulty in gettign defined tames and tables columns to autocomplete
