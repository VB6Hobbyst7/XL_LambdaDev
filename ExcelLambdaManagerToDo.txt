Create category functionality within the lambdas (most probably have to store in the comments)

 - Lambdas can be refreshed in target sheet with spreadsheetBI, maybe with a listbox of lambda selections so that all lambdas do not clutter up spreadsheet
    
 - Maybe create an add-in with a combined roll of generator of table as well as refresher of defined names

 - Need to complete Function IsValidRepo
