Test git update

I am tempted to bring in the list storage class into the project
 - store the repos in a listStorage class object

Create category functionality within the lambdas (most probably have to store in the comments)

 - Lambdas can be refreshed in target sheet with spreadsheetBI, maybe with a listbox of lambda selections so that all lambdas do not clutter up spreadsheet
    
 - Maybe create an add-in with a combined roll of generator of table as well as refresher of defined names

 - Need to complete Function IsValidRepo

  - Can I use visual code for editing formulas (and launch from excel)
  
  How hard would it be to create Excel formula language support in Visual Studio code
 * Additioal complexity would be difficulty in gettign defined tames and tables columns to autocomplete
