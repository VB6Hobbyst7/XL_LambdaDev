Sharing and maintaining lambdas
 - Maybe explore XML
 - below link can read txt from raw github files 
 https://www.devhut.net/2013/09/20/vba-read-a-file-from-a-webserver-or-internet-website/
 - Sheets in excel lambda creator file have cells containing lambdas, lambda categories and comments for name manager
 - Lambdas can be refreshed in target sheet with spreadsheetBI, maybe with a listbox of lambda selections so that all lambdas do not clutter up spreadsheet
 - Delimitting between comments and lambda is difficult - can I store a table in a readme somehow?  --> can I store in HTML table format in github
    https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp
    Cants seem to get power query to link to table stored in github
    
 - Maybe create an add-in with a combined roll of generator of table as well as refresher of defined names
